*style documentation and assets/concepts*
 
### This repo will host all project files for any assets and also any rendered concepts for the sake of ease of access.

*Quick notes:*

- Encore's visual style is player-centric. The player should be allowed to choose a color that fits with them that will represent their access across every menu and in gameplay.
